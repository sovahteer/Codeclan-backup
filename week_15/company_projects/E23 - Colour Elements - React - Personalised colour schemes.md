## E23: Colour Elements - React - Interactive colour scheme picker

### Company background

Colour Elements is a personal fashion consultancy which helps people identify their personal style and colour scheme. Their services are targeted at people who want a quick advice from fashion stylists. 
Stylists help you to identify your own Colour Guide, a set of colour schemes best suitable to your unique features and personality. You could think of it as your colour equivalent of Myers-Briggs personality type - each person is described by their primary and secondary ‘element’ (eg. fire, earth, air) that then dictate which colours you should wear. Having this information at your fingertips will change the way that you buy clothes and put outfits together. And that’s where you come in.

### Project background

Your team will prototype and build a quick React prototype for exploring individual's colour schemes. The user will be able to enter their two elements and see colour combinations matching them.

Display a palette with random colour combination for user’s elements

### Extensions
