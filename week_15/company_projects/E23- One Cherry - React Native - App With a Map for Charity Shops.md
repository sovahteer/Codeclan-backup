##One Cherry - Online Charity Shops - expanding a React Native app with map functionality

### Hello E23! We are One Cherry, an award-winning social enterprise startup based in Edinburgh.

We created an **online marketplace for second-hand shops and charity shops** ([www.onecherry.co.uk](www.onecherry.co.uk)), where customers can effortlessly buy items online, then collect them in-store. Our main goal is to make sustainable second-hand shopping more accessible while supporting local charity shops and community projects.

We launched a couple of months ago with our first two shops in Edinburgh, releasing a responsive web app for customers and shops. To further improve customerâ€™s experience, we are currently building a native mobile app using **React Native**, which will include a brand new feature - an interactive map. Location based services and apps are extremely popular these days and you most likely have seen and used them before: Uber, AirBnB, Just Eat, Deliveroo and so on.  

In our case, the map will help our users find local shops and preloved items that they sell: from clothing to books, furniture, bikes, you name it. We have a large database of all shops in Edinburgh with some information about them that you can use. Some shops will also provide a list of items they currently have in stock and users should be able to efficiently use the map to find what they are looking for. We hope you and your team will be able to take this challenge!

###Brief: 
Use React Native to build a map view with a filter for shops and items they sell.

1. **MVP:**
Users can see all shops on a map view and look up the details of any particular shop.
1. **A Great Feature:**
Users can use a filter to only see shops that match particular criteria, e.g. the shop is within a particular distance from the user or if the shop sells furniture or electronics, etc.
1. **An Amazing Feature:** Users can use pinch-zoom to select shops in a certain radius and display items from these shops. 

We will provide a draft InVision prototype and some pre-made React Native components.

Look forward to hearing from you!
