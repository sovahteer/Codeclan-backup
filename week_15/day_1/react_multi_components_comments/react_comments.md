# React Comments

## Learning Objectives

* Create a multiple component React application
* Understand the difference between state and props
* Learn how to pass data between components

## Comments Application

We want to create a comments feature which displays a list of comments and has a form that allow us to add a comment.

We do this in React by describing how the whole page should be drawn.

There will be nothing more added to our HTML, the whole application will be drawn by Javascript using React. We do this by describing components for our UI in a component **_hierarchy_**.

Let's first build a static application that will render based on a hard coded array of comments. This is often a good place to start with a React application.

## Application Skeleton

We are now going to create a skeleton hierarchy for our application. Today we are going to render comment list, tomorrow we will add the form. So our component hierarchy will look like this:

* CommentBox { state = comments } renders...
* CommentList { props = comments } renders...
* Comment { props = comment }

Components can have child components. The child components of our CommentBox are CommentList, and CommentForm. CommentList will have multiple Comment components nested inside it.

### First Component

Let's use `create-react-app` to bootstrap our application.

```bash
create-react-app comments
cd comments
npm start
```

OK! Through the magic of `create-react-app`, we've pulled down all the bits and pieces we need to start off. We do need to tidy up a little bit, though.

```bash
# cmd-t, new tab
cd src
rm logo.svg App.css
```

At this point, the app has broken, because we've removed stuff that we're importing into our app. Let's fix that. And while we're at it, let's remove some default JSX.

```js
import React, { Component } from "react";

// DELETE THE NEXT TWO LINES
import logo from "./logo.svg";
import "./App.css";

class App extends Component {
  render() {
    return (
      // DELETE EVERYTHING FROM HERE...
      <div className="App">
        <header className="App-header">
          <img src={logo} className="App-logo" alt="logo" />
          <h1 className="App-title">Welcome to React</h1>
        </header>
        <p className="App-intro">
          To get started, edit <code>src/App.js</code> and save to reload.
        </p>
      </div>
      // ... TO HERE
    );
  }
}

export default App;
```

Let's build our first component. It'll be the parent component for all our others.

React components must implement a render method that returns what we want it to display. It is automatically called by React so we have to call it 'render' so that React can find it. This is part of the component lifecycle...  
[React Component Specs](https://facebook.github.io/react/docs/component-specs.html)

We'll be creating two directories here: `containers` and `components`. Each of the app's elements that we create will live in one or other folder.

So what's the difference? Well, if a particular element just contains presentational code, then it would probably live in the `components` directory. If it contains logic, or holds the _state_ of the program - its data - then it would probably live in the `containers` directory.

> There's a bit more to it than this, but this should suffice for now.

```bash
mkdir src/components
mkdir src/containers
touch src/containers/CommentBox.js
```

First let's create and render a simple component out to our page to check that everything is hooked up and working correctly.

```js
// src/containers/CommentBox.js
import React, { Component } from "react";

class CommentBox extends Component {
  render() {
    return <div className="comment-box">Hello, world! I am a CommentBox.</div>;
  }
}

export default CommentBox;
```

```js
import React, { Component } from "react";
import CommentBox from "./containers/CommentBox";

class App extends Component {
  render() {
    return <CommentBox />;
  }
}

export default App;
```

Similarly we will make the empty component for our CommentList.

```bash
touch src/components/CommentList.js
```

```js
// src/components/CommentList.js
import React, { Component } from "react";

class CommentList extends Component {
  render() {
    return (
      <div className="comment-list">Hello, world! I am a CommentList.</div>
    );
  }
}

export default CommentList;
```

We now want our `CommentBox` component to render the `CommentList` component. Let's add it to the hierarchy.

```js
// src/containers/CommentBox.js
import React, { Component } from "react";
import CommentList from "../components/CommentList"; //UPDATED

class CommentBox extends Component {
  render() {
    return (
      <div className="comment-box">
        <CommentList /> //UPDATED
      </div>
    );
  }
}

export default CommentBox;
```

## Comment Component

### Properties

Let's create the `Comment` component, which will depend on data passed in from its parent. Data passed in from a parent component is available as a 'property' on the child component. These 'properties' are accessed through `this.props`. A special property is `this.props.children`, which refers to any text or elements written between the JSX opening and closing tags.

Properties are immutable, components can not change their properties, they are just given them. Using props, we will be able to read the data passed to the `Comment` from the `CommentList`, and render some markup:

```bash
touch src/components/Comment.js
```

```js
// src/components/CommentList.js

import React, { Component } from "react";
import Comment from "./Comment"; //UPDATED

class CommentList extends Component {
  render() {
    return (
      <div className="comment-list">
        <Comment author="Rick Henry">Cool</Comment> // UPDATE
        <Comment author="Valerie Gibson">Nice</Comment> // UPDATE
      </div>
    );
  }
}

export default CommentList;
```

```js
// src/components/Comment.js
import React, { Component } from "react";

class Comment extends Component {
  render() {
    return (
      <div className="comment">
        <h4 className="comment-author">{this.props.author}</h4>
        {this.props.children}
      </div>
    );
  }
}

export default Comment;
```

## Data Model

We have hard coded the data in a list of comments. We now want to create a simple array of comments which will be drawn by the view. We are going to set up our CommentBox to be in control of the data. It will handle the comment data, and later on updating it.

## State

Our CommentBox is going to be the master of the state of our application, the array of comments.

For now we'll just make some mock data. If we were creating a proper app we could get this from our server.

```js
// src/containers/CommentBox.js
class CommentBox extends Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);
    this.state = {
      data: [{ author: "Beth", text: "I love cats!" }] //UPDATED
    };
  }

  render() {
    return (
      <div className="comment-box">
        <h2>Comment List</h2> //UPDATED
        <CommentList data={this.state.data} /> //UPDATED
      </div>
    );
  }
}
```

Our comment box controls state and creates a dumb list.

This list has no state (things it can change), it just has the comments it has been given and uses as properties. We'll create an array of comment components and give them the properties of the author and the text. 

Any string put inside our tags can be accessed as children properties. React wants a key element on array items to uniquely identify them.

```js
// src/components/CommentList.js
class CommentList extends Component {
  render() {
    const commentNodes = this.props.data.map((comment, index) => {
      return (
        <Comment author={comment.author} key={index}>
          {comment.text}
        </Comment>
      );
    });

    return <div className="comment-list">{commentNodes}</div>;
  }
}
```

> Note: If you remove the `key={index}` from the Comment component you will see the app still works, but there is a warning in the console. React wants us to give any collection of components a unique identifyer so that it can optimise it's re-rendering should it need to make changes to one of the components. It uses the `key` property to identify which element to rerender.

Tomorrow we will look at adding a form to the application so users can add comments to the application.
