##E23: Political News Scraping in Python
 
###Background
NewsDirect is a small data gathering consultancy helping organisations keep track of political discussions and current affairs. For example a cancer charity might want to know immediately if a politician mentions them in a debate or if a political party issues a press release calling for funding for a new treatment.
 
### Current Problem 
NewsDirect are currently using a combination of external automation tools and a lot of human news analysts. This is not very efficient or quick, so they would like to streamline their process with use of web scraping and computer data analysis that would parse and simplify the material for human analysts. Now NewsDirect are looking for a group of 3-4 students to join them for a week and build a prototype/proof-of-concept of such tool. You will work very closely with one of their analysts who has some basic programming knowledge.

###Solution
The tool you'll be building will automate analysis of websites for desired words and prepare simple reports for human analysts. Exact details and process will be developed between you and the NewsDirect team. It is recommended that you follow the Agile process you learned at CodeClan: Standups, Sprints, Pair/Mob-Programming, Testing, etc. Depending on what your team decides to do, you can build this prototype in Ruby or learn a new language (Python) or framework (Ruby-on-Rails).
 
### Opportunity 
This project provides students with a set of unique opportunities:

- working on company premisses
- working on a real life project with a real life customer
- interacting with real life data
 
###MVP

- Extend further the work that last two cohorts performed
- use multiple Scottish Government APIs to create better quality reports
- work with a group of political analysts to improve their work-flow by automating some tasks
 
###Extensions

- Bring the product to the next iteration in a good enough state that it will be used by the team of analysts in their every-day work
