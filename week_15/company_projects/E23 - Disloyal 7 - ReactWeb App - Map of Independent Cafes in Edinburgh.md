##E23: Interactive Map of Independent Cafes in Edinburgh

> note: you will pick up the work of E22, so some of the tasks will be already completed.

###Background 

A few years ago a collective of 7 independent cafe owners created a list of best independent cafes in Edinburgh. Their ethos was that real coffee lovers don’t always go to the same place to have coffee, but rather explore new places and independent small coffee shops. They created a paper ‘disloyalty card’ called Disloyal7 where instead of getting stamps from the same place, you get stamps from different cafes, and your goal is to visit them all.

Since then the project did not really grow much, but stayed active in terms of paper disloyalty cards, and this is where you will come in. You will build a digital, Open Source version of the Disloyal7 using the tools you learned during the course.

This brief will suit a group of 4ish students with interest in project design and real life applications. You will work with one of cafe managers (who will be your client) and the UX designer behind the original Disloyal7 card.

###Task

You will build a mobile-friendly website with a map of Disloyal7 cafes in Edinburgh which allows people to filter results (by things like: outdoors sitting, serving food, opening hours). You will be given a json file with cafe data and might build a simple API that serves it, or just hardcode it into your app at this stage.
If the outcome is presentable, it has high chances of being promoted and shared among coffee lovers over the festival period and making a real dent in Edinburgh coffee lover scene.

This project provides students with a set of unique opportunities:

- working on a real life project with a real life customer and UX consultant
- interacting with real life data and APIs
- working with geographic map data and filtering
- taking part in creation and growth of an open source project

###MVP 

- Perform UX process with cafe manager, UX expert and possibly some coffee lovers
- A simple API or hardcoded json will provide information about cafes, their location and details.
- Filter cafes by some criteria, and show only some of them on a map.
- Build a mobile friendly website displaying that map and filtering per pre-defined criteria

###Extensions

- Show user’s location on the map
- Deploy to a server (eg. Heroku)
- Connect to a domain 
- Expanding database of info about cafes

###Further Extensions

- User can mark some cafes as visited, this could use location of the user to simplify the process. This will require some per-user data persistence (unique link, cookies, or simple login).
- Visiting cafes would give user disloyalty points.
- Users can write simple reviews/notes.
