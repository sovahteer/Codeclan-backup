===Enums===

#1 What is an enum?
  In Java, an enum(erator) is a class type that is used to define a collection of
  data in a program that will never change.
  - more or less correct.

#2 What method do we use to get all the entries in an enum? What type of object
does this method return?
  the .values method will return an array of all items inside an enum
  - correct.

#3 Can you associate more than one value with an entry in an enum?
  Yes, you can associate several values with an entry in an enum e.g. integers
  and strings.
  - more or less correct.

#4 We saw that enums can have constructors. Can you call the constructor in the
same way as you would for a class?
  No, the constructor is actually private and is used to initialise any
  variables in the enum.

===Hashmaps===

#1 What is a HashMap in Java?
  A Hashmap is a collection class (like has in Ruby =P) that is used for storing pairs
  of keys and values.
  - correct.

#2 Can you store value types (e.g. int, char) in a Hashmap?
  No, you can only store reference types. For example, for an int you would
  use the Integer class.

#3 How do you add a new entry into a HashMap?
  by using the .put(key,value) method
  - correct.

#4 How do you retrieve a value from a Hashmap?
  by using .get(key) method
  - correct.

#5 Name 3 other methods you can call on a Hashmap and explain what they do
  .size() returns the size of the hashmap as an integer
  .clear() clears the HashMap
  .remove(key) removes an entry in the Hashmap with a given key
