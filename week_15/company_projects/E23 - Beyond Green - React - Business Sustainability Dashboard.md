## E23: Beyond Green - React - Business Sustainability Dashboard
###Company background
Beyond Green (BG), located a 10 minute walk from CodeClan, is a sustainability consultancy helping businesses to achieve their sustainability goals. BG have worked previously with two sets of final week CodeClan students on the development of an online sustainability dashboard. Now, BG are looking for another group of 2-4 students to join them for a week and develop the project further.

###Project background
You’re taking part in prototyping an online platform for businesses who want to understand and improve their sustainability. Teams from previous two cohorts have continued building a React app with of inputs, calculations and outputs. You will pick up where they finished it, refactor and expand their code.

This project will provide you exposure to 

* Real working practices of a consultancy, following their workflow, working with various team members within their specific specialisation (data analysts, business/client relations)
* Building a product that fits within teams working flow. This will require modeling a UX of pre-existing solution and modifying it in small implements.
* React development of a pre-existing code of various quality. This is possibly the most exciting and rare opportunity for you to have impact on a software project at an architectural level.
* Working as a part of a long term project with its own past, present and future. You’ll need to understand historic and business reasons for particular parts of software; take over someone’s code and work on it; and prepare your own code for being used by other programmers.
* Constantly morphing and changing client requirements, which are always a part of real-life projects. Agile methodology will help you with this. 

The real-world experience this projects offers, will prepare you for situations you will likely encounter as you begin to join existing projects in new workplaces.

###MVP
* Enable a user to enter their business’ data and see their current energy impacts and available options for improvement. This is partially done, but you’ll need to connect data from user input with, calculations in model and output.
* Connect Data layer to the program, this can be a database, or text file (csv, json). Here you will store other businesses’ information to provide averages and insights.

###Extensions
* Time related calculations: Use average payback period to provide estimated investment cost for user to see
* Expanding existing graphs: Turn energy, carbon and cost savings for each resource efficiency option into comparison graphs

###Outcomes for students
* An opportunity to work with team of professional sustainability advisors in a business environment 
* Experience to work on a live project rather than tried and tested classroom exercise. 
* Gain experience working with existing code,  programming new code, and preparing a hand-over

###Some steps you’ll take during the week:
1. Briefing: Review and understand previous code, and its effect on the platform’s UI (previous cohort members will brief you)
1. Orientation: Understand and diagram the current platform architecture, and the function of critical components
1. Extract Model (following Model-View-Controller separation): Extract from current code a a way to store business data that users entered via the interface. In this part of code you will perform calculations on these data. Interface will pass data in and get data out from here.
1. (optional) Extract Data Storage layer: Create a storage method to retrieve text used throughout the app  (all english words from code should be extracted i.e. into constants)
1. Perform calculations for energy saving, which leads to cost and carbon savings (9 measures). These will be operations in Model.
1. Output energy, cost and carbon saving figures for user to see (from Model to View)
1. Refactoring of code/tidy up visual outputs
1. Update Documentation and finalise the Hand-over (i.e the backlog)
